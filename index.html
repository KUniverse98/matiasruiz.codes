                <h2>About Myself</h2>
                <p>I got into coding during a tough chapter. I didn't have a plan, just a keyboard and a drive to figure things out.
                    Over time, it became more than curiosity — it became an obsession. I love solving problems, building things that work,
                    and getting better every day.
                </p>
                <p>I'm a father of two, learning to build something real from the ground up. I'm not here because of a fancy background —
                    I'm here because I put in the work. I'm learning fast, and I'm coming for everything I never had.
                </p>
